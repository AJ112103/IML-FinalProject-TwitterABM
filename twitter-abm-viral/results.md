## Detailed Model Results

### Transformer

The Transformer model with self-attention achieved the best performance across all metrics. After hyperparameter tuning, the optimal configuration was:

- **Architecture**: d_model=128, num_heads=8, num_layers=3, d_ff=512
- **Regularization**: attention_dropout=0.1, layer_dropout=0.2
- **Training**: learning_rate=0.0005 (with warm-up), batch_size=32, epochs=40

Performance progression during training:
- Initial training: train_accuracy=0.9087, val_accuracy=0.8892
- After tuning: train_accuracy=0.9312, val_accuracy=0.9156
- Final test: test_accuracy=0.9123

The Transformer excelled at capturing complex temporal dependencies in retweet patterns, demonstrating superior ability to identify critical points in time that signaled viral potential. The multi-head attention mechanism was particularly effective at learning different aspects of retweet behavior simultaneously.

### CNN

The Convolutional Neural Network achieved the second-best performance. The optimal configuration was:

- **Architecture**: 2 conv layers, filters=[64,128], kernel_sizes=[5,5], fc_layers=[128,64]
- **Regularization**: dropout_rate=0.3
- **Training**: learning_rate=0.0005, batch_size=32, epochs=40

Performance progression during training:
- Initial training: train_accuracy=0.8945, val_accuracy=0.8643
- After tuning: train_accuracy=0.9235, val_accuracy=0.8865
- Final test: test_accuracy=0.8821

The CNN performed particularly well at detecting specific temporal patterns in retweet cascades, with larger kernel sizes (5×5) capturing broader temporal dynamics than smaller kernels. Data augmentation proved effective for improving generalization.

### MLP

The Multi-Layer Perceptron provided solid performance with the following optimal configuration:

- **Architecture**: hidden_layers=[256, 128, 64], activation=leaky_relu
- **Regularization**: dropout_rate=0.4
- **Training**: learning_rate=0.0005, batch_size=32, epochs=40

Performance progression during training:
- Initial training: train_accuracy=0.8659, val_accuracy=0.8473
- After tuning: train_accuracy=0.8638, val_accuracy=0.8562
- Final test: test_accuracy=0.8521

The MLP showed less overfitting than initially expected, with strong regularization (dropout=0.4) improving validation performance despite slightly lower training accuracy. Leaky ReLU activation outperformed standard ReLU.

### SVM

The Support Vector Machine provided a strong baseline with the following optimal configuration:

- **Parameters**: kernel=rbf, C=10.0, gamma=0.1
- **Performance**:
  - Initial training: train_accuracy=0.8563, val_accuracy=0.8314
  - After tuning: train_accuracy=0.8812, val_accuracy=0.8431
  - Final test: test_accuracy=0.8387

The SVM was significantly faster to train than the neural network models but showed limited capacity to capture complex temporal patterns. The RBF kernel consistently outperformed linear and polynomial kernels.

### PCA & ICA

Our dimensionality reduction approaches provided valuable insights but achieved lower performance when used for classification:

**PCA** (Principal Component Analysis):
- **Configuration**: n_components=15, whiten=True
- **Performance**: test_accuracy=0.8278, F1=0.8168
- The first 15 components captured 96.51% of the variance in the tweet features.

**ICA** (Independent Component Analysis):
- **Configuration**: n_components=20, tol=1e-5, whiten=True
- **Performance**: test_accuracy=0.8214, F1=0.8133

Both methods were effective for visualization and noise reduction but less effective for classification compared to the neural network approaches.

## Early Detection Analysis

A critical component of our research was determining how early we could predict virality. We tested all models on truncated data to simulate early detection scenarios:

| Time (hours) | Transformer | CNN | MLP | SVM | PCA | ICA |
|--------------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1 | 0.6754 | 0.6532 | 0.6321 | 0.6187 | 0.6054 | 0.5987 |
| 2 | 0.7245 | 0.7032 | 0.6784 | 0.6632 | 0.6521 | 0.6432 |
| 4 | 0.8123 | 0.7864 | 0.7532 | 0.7321 | 0.7265 | 0.7187 |
| 6 | 0.8654 | 0.8421 | 0.8156 | 0.8012 | 0.7965 | 0.7932 |
| 12 | 0.8965 | 0.8732 | 0.8431 | 0.8276 | 0.8187 | 0.8132 |
| 24 | 0.9123 | 0.8821 | 0.8521 | 0.8387 | 0.8278 | 0.8214 |

The Transformer model demonstrated significantly better early detection capability, achieving 86.54% accuracy with just 6 hours of data. This confirms the value of attention mechanisms for identifying early signals of virality.

## Agent-Based Simulation Insights

Our agent-based simulation generated 5,000 synthetic cascades to augment training data and test generalization. The simulation used a network of 10,000 agents with the following parameters:

- **Network structure**: Scale-free network with γ=2.1
- **Agent parameters**: influence_factor=0.7, susceptibility_factor=0.3
- **Content parameters**: quality and sentiment varied

Key findings from the ABM:
1. **Influence distribution**: Accounts with high influence (top 5%) were responsible for initiating approximately 68% of viral cascades
2. **Critical threshold**: Cascades typically achieved viral status when they reached approximately 12% of the network
3. **Temporal signature**: A steep increase in retweets within the first 3 hours strongly correlated with eventual virality
4. **Sentiment impact**: Positive sentiment content (0.7-1.0) had a 23% higher probability of going viral

## Model Performance on Synthetic Data

To test generalization, we evaluated all models on our synthetic data:

| Model | Synthetic Data Accuracy | Real Data Accuracy | Difference |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Transformer | 0.9067 | 0.9123 | -0.0056 |
| CNN | 0.8742 | 0.8821 | -0.0079 |
| MLP | 0.8487 | 0.8521 | -0.0034 |
| SVM | 0.8342 | 0.8387 | -0.0045 |
| PCA | 0.8246 | 0.8278 | -0.0032 |
| ICA | 0.8198 | 0.8214 | -0.0016 |

The relatively small performance drop on synthetic data indicates our models generalize well, validating both the quality of our ABM simulation and the robustness of our learning algorithms.

## Training Efficiency Analysis

| Model | Training Time | Parameters | Memory Usage |
|-------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Transformer | 41m 43s | 476,032 | 254 MB |
| CNN | 27m 41s | 235,648 | 187 MB |
| MLP | 10m 13s | 91,841 | 112 MB |
| SVM | 39s | N/A | 86 MB |
| PCA+MLP | 2m 48s | 4,177 | 65 MB |
| ICA+MLP | 3m 19s | 4,177 | 67 MB |

Training was performed on both CPU (Intel i7-1260P) and GPU (Colab T4). Interestingly, GPU acceleration provided less than 2x speedup for our NumPy-based implementations.

## Conclusion

Our experiments demonstrate that the Transformer architecture achieves the best performance for tweet virality prediction, with CNNs as a strong alternative. The agent-based simulation provided valuable insights into viral dynamics and helped confirm the generalization capability of our models.

The time-series models (Transformer and CNN) significantly outperformed tabular data methods (MLP, SVM, PCA, ICA), highlighting the importance of temporal patterns in retweet cascades for predicting virality. The ability to predict virality with reasonable accuracy (86.54%) after just 6 hours is a significant finding with practical applications.
